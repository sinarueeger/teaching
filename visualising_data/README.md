- What tools are good for what data
- 


## Topics

- Rules
- Grammar of graphics
- 

## Slides

1. Brief recap about data shape and data types
2. Restate the overall goal: using the most data in the most accurate way
3. Why do we love visualisations? 
4. Different grades of summary: dataset > scatterplot > mean
4. Look at 5 different visualisation tools
5. Steps of making a good visualisation
6. Some rules (tufte ggplot2 etc).
7. Show examples where these rules are harmed (traffic light)
8. some practical aspects: advantages of saving as a pdf or a png (manipulation) + tools to use (reproducibility)


## Validation of User Learning
- let them choose between graphs
- Make a graph on 
- why are 3d graphs not good



3. The power of visualising data (#5)
Take a data set and create two data visualisations (one better than the other). Ask the learner to pick the visualisation that represents the data the best and explain why.
