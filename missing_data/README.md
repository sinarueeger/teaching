# Missing data

## Why I choose this topic
As a data analyst, I am confronted with missing data on a daily basis. In my opinion, this is an underestimated topic in data education, resulting for example to poorly documented (incomplete) data. 

## Knowledge of the learner
People being exposed to data products (such as visualisations or tables), but without any background in data or working with data.

## Aim
Discover different facets of missing data. 

## Topics
- Show different reason for the existence of missing data
